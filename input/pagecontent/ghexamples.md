# Gender Harmony Examples

## Additional Data Coding Examples
The following items are provided as examples that align with the data elements noted within the informative material.

The following tables were created by Clair Kronk. See Suggested Tables in Google Docs [81] for additional detail. These tables include potential extensions to these tables which may be useful in various scenarios. This document includes a 75 other potential values for gender identities, pronoun sets, assigned sex at birth values, among other things. Additionally, it includes usage notes and information to consider in regional implementations.

Cases linked to “Unknown” could be theoretically mapped to ‘U’ and specified answers not included here could be linked to ‘O’, but it is recommended to include the other options provided as necessary based on individual clinical use [81].

Kronk [81] also recommends certain additional terms be required in the US and Canada, specifically:

### Name to Use
Name to Use per [81]:
> *“This is a person’s name, specifically, the name that they use. This may differ from a patient’s legal name on certain identity documents, from the patient’s name registered with an insurance company, etc., but it is still their name. Do not use terms like “affirmed name”, “chosen name”, or “real name”, or “preferred name” as these imply that a transgender person’s name is somehow lesser than a cisgender (non-transgender) person’s name, and can be chosen to be ignored.”*

Cases linked to unknown (such as pronouns not stated) could theoretically be mapped to ‘U’ and neopronouns like ze/zir and xie/hir could be linked to ‘O’ in this situation, but it is recommended to include other pronouns provided as necessary based on individual clinical use. Please also note, a patient record may utilize more than one pronoun set.
