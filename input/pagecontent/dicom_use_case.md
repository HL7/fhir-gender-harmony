### Note to Balloters

This use case is illustrative of how ancillary systems in imaging, downstream from the EHR, are likely to consume and create evidence documents in response to Sex and Gender encoding. In this case, there are three instances of Sex For Clinical Use (SFCU). First, the ordering physicians provides instructions for interpreting lab values within a Sex for Clinical Use comment. In the second SFCU, an Artifical Intelligence (AI) application utilizes the Sex Assigned at Birth for the basis of reference values. Third, the radiologist determines the appropriate sex to use based on the patient's body composition for a Standard Uptake Value (SUV) calculation.
The DICOM (Digital Imaging and COmmunications in Medicine) attributes in this use case are not normative, and details in DICOM are still being defined. If interested in participating in development of DICOM Sex and Gender encoding please contact the [DICOM Secretariat](mailto:dicom@dicomstandard.org).

Public comment, based on this use case is sought on the following Open Issues:

1.  Technologist may be in a position to observe a discrepancy between the current medical record and “observed” information. Where and how is this communicated to other actors? Where and how is reconciliation performed? Considerations include:
    
    1.  Authoritative sources of observations
    
    2.  Official systems of record
    
    3.  See also IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) [Scheduled Workflow 34.4.2.2 Use Case \#2: Patient Update](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/Radiology/IHE_RAD_TF_Vol1.pdf#page=276) in which upstream systems (ADT / RIS) perform a patient update or merge.

2.  What imaging activities are effected by the discrepant observation, and how should those be handled prior to reconciliation (e.g. protocol selection, post processing, report content)?

3.  In the cross-community scenario:
	
	1.  How to manage the case if one jurisdiction does not recognize the sex/gender attributes of another? 
	
	2.  What impact will the patient name change have on the Master Patient Index weighting of search results? 
	
	3.  Is this likely to require a manual merge of records? [(see IHE ITI-30)](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ITI-30.html#3.30.5)

4.  A mix of upgraded and non-upgraded systems may result in a scenario in which one system, does not recognize sex attributes of the other. Priors are likely generated by non-upgraded systems. Search reliability may be negatively impacted when there is discrepant information (patient situation change, attributes within records have changed). How is this handled?

5.  How does this change in an encounter-based activity? Consider direct in-person clinical care vs tele health?

6.  How to deal with the non-communicative patient?

7.  Some machine-based algorithms are tuned based on patient age and sex at birth for the application of established reference values. How should this be considered?

8.  Are there updates that should be considered for the DICOM attribute, Confidentiality constraint on patient data (0040,3001) VR=LO, to support local confidentiality approaches that may be applied to transgender demographics changes?

9.  Should name to use be PN or LT VR? A patient, may want to be referred to as “Commander Bob”.

10. In this Use Case, a single ADT message is created to communicate the patient name change. Is the order of the repeating elements in PID-5 significant? Should there be one ADT message or two (i.e. one message to communicate the new name, a second message to flag the old name as "NOUSE")?

### Use Case Description:

Post Gender Harmony model implementation with incorrect naming from the EHR.

Patient with EHR Sex for Clinical Use (SFCU) of “female” and a EHR Gender Identity of “male” arrives for check-in at a facility using a DICOM worklist for a PET/CT examination. The examination is performed, the patient’s demographics are updated, and the report is delivered.

### Actors:

#### People

1.  Patient (John Smith) - whose previous records are for studies performed when his EHR Gender Identity was “female”. 

2.  Facility Clerk - admits patient, utilizes the Radiology Information System (RIS)

3.  PET/CT Technologist

4.  Recovery Nurse

#### Systems, (using IHE Actor names)

1.  Hospital EHR (ADT, Order Placer)

2.  RIS (Order Filler)

3.  PET/CT Modality System

4.  Image Manager/Archive (PACS: Picture Archive and Communications System)

5.  Dose Information Reporter

6.  AI (Artificial Intelligence) Task Performer

### Scope Statement:

Use case covers admission, patient prep, examination, recovery, post processing and reporting for a PET/CT examination order.

### Precondition(s):

1.  John Smith is registered in the hospital record system with his old name of “Janet Smith”

2.  Patient ID has not changed

3.  John Smith arrives at an outpatient facility with an appointment

4.  Patient history, social history, medical history has already been captured upstream and are available in the facility's EHR

5.  Physician order for examination is utilizing information from the facility

6.  Facility system has not been updated for the name change

7.  Relevant prior exams for comparison are retrieved based on rules established by the radiology department, using the name Janet Smith (e.g., body region, patient ID, type of exam).

8.  Technical scan and contrast administration parameters (protocol) are pre-determined based on departmental protocols for a female patient

[**Example 01**](#example-01-imaging-order) depicts a HL7 v2.9.1 Imaging Order for this patient with mapping to DICOM Modality Worklist attributes.

### Postcondition(s):

1.  PET/CT Examination is complete or cancelled

2.  Report is generated and available

3.  Discussion to initiate name change correction in the EHR has occurred

4.  DICOM Name to Use is updated based on policy. For example:
    
    1.  EHR name (John Smith) is associated with a Name to Use element whose validity period ends on day of exam
    
    2.  Add a Name to Use (Janet Smith) whose validity period begins on day of exam

### Workflow/Storyboard:

![](gh-dicom-2.svg)

Figure 1 Workflow Storyboard

#### Arrival and check-in:

In this scenario, the patient initiates the discussion with the clerk.

1.  When John arrives at the waiting room for a PET/CT examination he announces himself as “John”.

2.  The clerk asks “John Williams?”, seeing a John Williams in the schedule. 

3.  Response, “No, Smith”

4.  The clerk asks “Date of birth”

5.  Smith: “month, day, year”

6.  The clerk performs a date-of-birth based lookup and finds:

7.  A schedule entry for Janet Smith, with Patient’s Sex “F” and Patient’s Gender “M”, and with a Patient Names to Use “John Smith”. Sex Comment contains “Hormonal treatment, use affirmed gender Cr reference ranges\[1\]”.

8.  The clerk confirms that the birth dates match, confirms the patient’s identity in accordance with local policies, and checks in the patient.

9.  The HL7 v2.9.1 message is converted to DICOM Modality Worklist (MWL) Attributes (partial SOP Instance contents) for the MWL query. After check-in, the order is visible in the MWL

10. Based on clinic policies, the clerk asks whether John wants to go through the name change process at the clinic to reflect his preferred name. Name change is initiated.

11. The clerk notifies the technologist that the patient has arrived.

[**Example 02**](#example-02-patient-name-update) depicts a HL7 v2.9.1 Demographics Update message for this patient with mapping to DICOM Modality Worklist attributes.

#### Patient Preparation

1.  The technologist checks their schedule for John, and finds the order for “Janet Smith”, Patient’s Sex “F” and Patient’s Gender “M”, and with a Patient Names to Use “John Smith”. Sex Comment contains “Hormonal treatment, use affirmed gender Cr reference ranges”.

2.  The technologist greets the patient as “John” and reconfirms birthdate.

3.  The technologist directs the patient to a changing area and instructs the patient to remove jewelry and change into a gown.

4.  When the patient is ready, the technologist asks the necessary related preparation questions, e.g., pregnancy status, most recent menstruation, allergies, history, preferred arm for IV contrast administration, etc.

5.  The technologist explains the procedure to the patient and answers any questions the patient may have. 

6.  Since the protocol calls for a contrast-enhanced CT, the technologist reviews the most recent eGFR, bun and creatine.

7.  The technologist confers with the radiologist to discuss acceptable lab values for safe contrast administration, given the Sex Comment, as well as the patient’s GFR, bun and creatine.

8. The radiologist notes that the provided SFCU of Female, is not consistent with the SFCU Comment and calls the ordering physician to confirm.

8.  After discussing patient history with the ordering physician, the radiologist provides protocol alterations based on the  patient’s transgender status.

Note: The pre-identified protocol was based on a female patient (see item [8 in Precondition(s)](#preconditions)).

#### Examination

1.  The technologist knows to select the MWL entry for “Janet Smith” and expects a Patient’s Sex of “F”; this does not trigger a wrong patient concern.

2.  Patient demographics are loaded into the scanner demographics interface.

3.  The technologist applies alterations prescribed by the radiologist to scanner and contrast protocol. The radiotracer dose is not changed, as the department standardizes doses regardless of Patient’s Sex.

4.  The technologist starts an IV, administers radiotracer, and connects the contrast injector for the contrast-enhanced CT portion of the procedure.

5.  The study is performed.

6.  During administration of iodinated CT contrast, the patient complained of nausea. The technologist notifies the departmental nurse, who agrees to monitor the patient for an allergic reaction after the procedure.

7.  The images and Radiation Dose Structured Report (RDSR) are transferred to the PACS, Dose Information Reporter and AI Task
    Performer systems.

#### Analysis 

1.  The radiologist creates an SUV ROI on the PACS. The application detects the presence of Patient’s Sex (0010,0040) “F”, a Gender Code (0010,xxx4).(0008,0104) “Male” and Sex Assigned at Birth (0010,xx25) of “F” and prompts the radiologist to enter a value “M” or “F”.

2.  The Dose Information Reporter collects the RDSR, without exception since Patient’s Sex or Gender is not likely to influence deterministic risk calculation estimates.

3.  The AI task performer detects the Sex Assigned at Birth (0010,xx25) of “F”, the algorithm processes the images based on female reference values and transfers evidence documents to the PACS.

Note: Sex at Birth is required to determine reference values for AI and non-AI machine algorithims in various domains, such as cardiology and neurology.

#### Reporting

1.  The radiologist dictates findings pertaining to the procedure, noting scanner and contrast protocol modifications in the “Request” section of the report.

2.  The report format has been configured to include Patient’s Sex (0010,0040), Patient’s Gender Code (0010,xxx4).(0008,0104), Patient Name (0010,xxx3).(0010,xx12) and SFCU Comment (0010,xxx1) in the report.

3.  The initial report reads:
> Patient’s Name = “Janet Smith”  
> Patient’s Sex = “F”  
> Patient’s Gender = “M”  
> Name to Use = “John Smith"  


4.  After the patient’s name change has been processed, the report is addended. The addended report reads:
> Patient’s Name = “John Smith”  
> Patient’s Sex = “F”  
> Patient’s Gender = “M”  
> Name to Use = “John Smith" 

The final report may be represented in [FHIR](#example-03-fhir-mapping), [HL7 v2](#example-04-imaging-report), or a [CDA](#example-05-cda-release-2-imaging-report).
