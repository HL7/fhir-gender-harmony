# x.1 DICOM® Use Case (DRAFT)

### Note to Balloters

This use case is illustrative of how ancillary systems in imaging,
downstream from the EHR, are likely to consume and create evidence
documents in response to Sex and Gender encoding. The DICOM (Digital
Imaging and COmmunications in Medicine) attributes in this use case are
not normative, and details in DICOM are still being defined. If
interested in participating in development of DICOM Sex and Gender
encoding please contact the [DICOM
Secretariat](mailto:dicom@dicomstandard.org).

Public comment, based on this use case is sought on the following Open
Issues:

1.  Technologist may be in a position to observe a discrepancy between
    the current medical record and “observed” information. Where and how
    is this communicated to other actors? Where and how is
    reconciliation performed? Considerations include:
    
    - Authoritative sources of observations
    
    - Official systems of record
    
    - See also IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise)
      [SWF](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/Radiology/IHE_RAD_TF_Vol1.pdf)
      (Scheduled Workflow) Patient Information Reconciliation workflow
      in which upstream systems (ADT / RIS) perform patient update or
      merge.

2.  What imaging activities are effected by the discrepant observation,
    and how should those be handled prior to reconciliation (e.g.
    protocol selection, post processing, report content)?

3.  In the cross-community scenario, how to manage the case if one
    jurisdiction does not recognize the sex/gender attributes of
    another?

4.  A mix of upgraded and non-upgraded systems may result in a scenario
    in which one system, does not recognize sex attributes of the other.
    Priors are likely generated by non-upgraded systems. Search
    reliability may be negatively impacted when there is discrepant
    information (patient situation change, attributes within records
    have changed). How is this handled?

5.  How does this change in an encounter-based activity? Consider direct
    in-person clinical care vs tele health?

6.  How to deal with the non-communicative patient?

7.  Some machine-based algorithms are tuned based on patient age and sex
    at birth for the application of established reference values. How
    should this be considered?

### x.1.1 Use Case Description:

Post Gender Harmony model implementation with incorrect naming from the
EHR.

Patient with EHR Sex for Clinical Use (SFCU) of “female” and a EHR
Gender Identity of “male” arrives for check-in at a facility using a
DICOM worklist for a PET/CT examination. The examination is performed,
the patient’s demographics are updated, and the report is delivered.

### x.1.2 Actors:

#### People

1.  Patient (John Smith) - whose previous records are for studies
    performed when his EHR Gender Identity was “female”. 

2.  Facility Clerk - admits patient, utilizes the Radiology Information
    System (RIS)

3.  PET/CT Technologist

4.  Recovery Nurse

#### Systems, (using IHE Actor names)

1.  Hospital EHR (ADT, Order Placer)

2.  RIS (Order Filler)

3.  PET/CT Modality System

4.  Image Manager/Archive (PACS: Picture Archive and Communications
    System)

5.  Dose Information Reporter

6.  AI (Artificial Intelligence) Task Performer

### x.1.3 Scope Statement:

Use case covers admission, patient prep, examination, recovery, post
processing and reporting for a PET/CT examination order.

### x.1.4 Precondition(s):

1.  John Smith is registered in the hospital record system with his old
    name of “Janet Smith”

2.  Patient ID has not changed

3.  John Smith arrives at an outpatient facility with an appointment

4.  Patient history, social history, medical history has already been
    captured upstream and are available in the facility's EHR

5.  Physician order for examination is utilizing information from the
    facility

6.  Facility system has not been updated for the name change

7.  Relevant prior exams for comparison are retrieved based on rules
    established by the radiology department, using the name Janet Smith
    (e.g., body region, patient ID, type of exam).

8.  Technical scan and contrast administration parameters (protocol) are
    pre-determined based on departmental protocols for a female patient

**Example 01** depicts a HL7 v2.9.1 Imaging Order for this patient with
mapping to DICOM Modality Worklist attributes.

### x.1.5 Postcondition(s):

1.  PET/CT Examination is complete or cancelled

2.  Report is generated and available

3.  Discussion to initiate name change correction in the EHR has
    occurred

4.  DICOM Name to Use is updated based on policy. For example:
    
    - EHR name (John Smith) is associated with a Name to Use element
        whose validity period ends on day of exam
    
    - Add a Name to Use (Janet Smith) whose validity period begins on
        day of exam

### x.1.6 Workflow/Storyboard:

![](media/image1.png)

Figure Workflow Storyboard

#### x.1.6.1 Arrival and check-in:

In this scenario, the patient initiates the discussion with the clerk.

1.  When John arrives at the waiting room for a PET/CT examination he
    announces himself as “John”.

2.  The clerk asks “John Williams?”, seeing a John Williams in the
    schedule. 

3.  Response, “No, Smith”

4.  The clerk asks “Date of birth”

5.  Smith: “month, day, year”

6.  The clerk performs a date-of-birth based lookup and finds:

7.  A schedule entry for Janet Smith, with Patient’s Sex (0010,0040) “F”
    and Patient’s Gender (0010,xxxx) “M”, and with a Preferred Form of
    Address (0010,xxx3) “Preferred name is John”. Sex Comment
    (0010,xxx1) contains “Hormonal treatment, use affirmed gender Cr
    reference ranges\[1\]”.

8.  The clerk confirms that the birth dates match, confirms the
    patient’s identity in accordance with local policies, and checks
    in the patient.

9.  The HL7 v2.9.1 message is converted to DICOM Modality Worklist (MWL)
    Attributes (partial SOP Instance contents) for the MWL query. After
    check-in, the order is visible in the MWL

10. Based on clinic policies, the clerk asks whether John wants to go
    through the name change process at the clinic to reflect his
    preferred name. Name change is initiated.

11. The clerk notifies the technologist that the patient has arrived.

**Example 02** depicts a HL7 v2.9.1 Demographics Update message for this
patient with mapping to DICOM Modality Worklist attributes.

#### x.1.6.2 Patient Preparation

1.  The technologist checks their schedule for John, and finds the order
    for “Janet Smith”, Patient’s Sex (0010,0040) “F” and Patient’s
    Gender (0010,xxxx) “M”, and with a Patient Name to Use (0010,xxx3)
    “John”. Sex Comment (0010,xxx1) contains “Hormonal treatment, use
    affirmed gender Cr reference ranges”.

2.  The technologist greets the patient as “John” and reconfirms
    birthdate.

3.  The technologist directs the patient to a changing area and
    instructs the patient to remove jewelry and change into a gown.

4.  When the patient is ready, the technologist asks the necessary
    related preparation questions, e.g., pregnancy status, most recent
    menstruation, allergies, history, preferred arm for IV contrast
    administration, etc.

5.  The technologist explains the procedure to the patient and answers
    any questions the patient may have.

6.  Since the protocol calls for a contrast-enhanced CT, the
    technologist reviews the most recent eGFR, bun and creatine.

7.  The technologist confers with the radiologist to discuss acceptable
    lab values for safe contrast administration, given the Sex Comment
    (0010,xxx1) as well as the patient’s GFR, bun and creatine.

8.  The radiologist provides protocol alterations based on the order
    indications and patient’s transgender status, since the
    pre-identified protocol was based on a female patient (see item 8 in
    preconditions).

#### x.1.6.3 Examination

1.  The technologist knows to select the MWL entry for “Janet Smith” and
    expects a Patient’s Sex (0010,0040) of “F”; this does not trigger a
    wrong patient concern.

2.  Patient demographics are loaded into the scanner demographics
    interface.

3.  The technologist applies alterations prescribed by the radiologist
    to scanner and contrast protocol. The radiotracer dose is not
    changed, as the department standardizes doses regardless of
    Patient’s Sex.

4.  The technologist starts an IV, administers radiotracer, and connects
    the contrast injector for the contrast-enhanced CT portion of the
    procedure.

5.  The exam is performed.

6.  During administration of iodinated CT contrast, the patient
    complained of nausea. The technologist notifies the departmental
    nurse, who agrees to monitor the patient for an allergic reaction
    after the procedure.

7.  The images and Radiation Dose Structured Report (RDSR) are
    transferred to the PACS, Dose Information Reporter and AI Task
    Performer systems.

#### x.1.6.4 Analysis 

1.  The radiologist creates an SUV ROI on the PACS. The application
    detects the presence of Patient’s Sex (0010,0040) “F” and Patient’s
    Gender (0010,xxxx) “M” and prompts the radiologist to enter a value
    “M” or “F”.

2.  The Dose Information Reporter collects the RDSR, without exception
    since Patient’s Sex or Gender is not likely to influence
    deterministic risk calculation estimates.

3.  The AI task performer processes the images based on female reference
    values and transfers evidence documents to the PACS.

#### x.1.6.5 Reporting

1.  The radiologist dictates findings pertaining to the procedure,
    noting scanner and contrast protocol modifications in the “Request”
    section of the report.

2.  The radiologist observes female reference values in the AI
    Measurement Report (TID 1500), and discards the AI findings, knowing
    that the reference values are not deterministic for patients
    undergoing hormonal treatment.

3.  The report format has been configured to include Patient’s Sex
    (0010,0040), Patient’s Gender (0010,xxxx), Name to Use (0010,xxx3)
    and Sex Comment (0010,xxx1) in the report header.

4.  The initial report header includes:
> Patient’s Name = “Janet Smith”  
> Patient’s Sex = “F”  
> Patient’s Gender = “M”  
> Name to Use = “John Smith"  

5.  After the patient’s name change has been processed, the report is addended. The header of the addendum now reads:
> Patient’s Name = “John Smith”  
> Patient’s Sex = “F”  
> Patient’s Gender = “M”  
> Name to Use = “John Smith"  

The final report may be represented in FHIR, CDA or an HL7 v2:

  - **Example 03** depicts a mapping to the FHIR R5 Patient resource
    that would be referenced as the subject of DiagnosticReport,
    DocumentReference, ImagingStudy or ImagingSelection

  - **Example 04** shows a CDA Release 2 Imaging Report based on the
    [example](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part20.html#sect_C.5.2)
    from DICOM PS3.20. CDA is a typical format in cross-enterprise
    ([XDS](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-10.html)) or
    cross-community document sharing
    ([XCA](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-18.html)).

  - **Example 05** depicts a HL7 v2.9.1 Unsolicited Observation Result
    containing the Imaging Report narrative.
