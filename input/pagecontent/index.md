### Introduction and balloter notes
This universal-realm implementation guide describes the changes incorporated in Hl7 product family specifications that can be used to align with the logical Gender Harmony model [published in 2021](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=564). Through the content of this guide, and the other ballots referenced in this guide that provide key normative track content (the V2 specification and the FHIR R5 core content), this guide provides definative guidance on how to exchange cliinical sex and gender afirming information using Hl7 models. We also provide examples that align with that guidance.

To accomplish that cross-paradigm goal, the guide provides:
- Introductory and background information, much drawn from previously published material.
- An overview on some of the design decisions that led to specific choices in modeling approach.
- Separate discussions for each of FHIR, V2x, and CDA product family enhancements that are intended to provide a consistent alignment with the Gender Harmony (GH) logical model, noting that the initial 2021 model has had some minor improvements based upon our work done after the initial publication.
  - The CDA templates are balloted as **Standard for Trial Use (STU) on the normative track**
  - The remaining content of this IG is balloted **Informative**.
- Value sets and code systems needed for the GH model artifacts.
  - Specified Note that the same terminology artifacts that are used in all product families. The value sets and code systems used are defined in the FHIR core R5 specification, bound to the GH extensions. The terminology is **not** defined in this guide. Please review the terminology and comment on the content in the FHIR R5 ballot.
- Examples that illustrate how to use the product family-specific enhancements in consistent ways to meet a use case.

### Conformance testable content

Of the information provided within this initial version of guide, only the CDA templates described in this guide are conformance testable and therefore the CDA template content in this guide is **Standard for Trial Use (STU)** to normative track. The Version 2 Gender Harmony **Normative** material **is conformance testable**, but while that specification is discussed in this guide, the conformance testable material is in the official V2.9.1 ballot found elsewhere, and the material is this guide is additional informative content. All new FHIR enhancements to support Gender Harmony modeling are changes to FHIR included in the R5 FHIR core specification described in the separate R5 FHIR ballot specification and all comments on the extensions and the related terminology **must be made on the FHIR R5 ballot**, not on this ballot. Each GH FHIR enhancement, except Name To Use, is an extension in the core FHIR specification. Guidance on the use of these extensions is the focus on this guide. If the community would like conformance-testable FHIR profiles that ensure use of the new extensions, ballot comments clarifying the need and requirements for those profiles should be provided on this implementation guide.

The approaches in data exchange discussed in this guide expand HL7 best practices to assist organizations that adapt and extend FHIR profiles and implementation guides in their jurisdictions (e.g., US, Canada) to meet business and regulatory requirements. We look forward to implementers embracing the approaches outlined.

### Background

As described in the original Gender Harmony logical model specification:

> Health care is increasingly turning to technology to help improve systems and processes to benefit patients and their health. Ongoing efforts supported by governing agencies and standards committees are responding to the demonstrated need through standards that allow for seamless integration of patient information between systems.

> It is imperative that both sex and gender vocabulary be formally integrated into clinical care because they are not interchangeable. Both influence health outcomes. Gender-marginalized individuals [(fn1)](#fn1)  face significant barriers to adequate and culturally responsive healthcare, leading to numerous health disparities. By adopting structured data sets, agnostic systems will be better equipped to transmit (share) and accept data elements that will improve the accuracy of patient information. Furthermore, standardizing data enables information to be combined with other data sources used to evaluate clinical outcomes. While data collection and documentation are critical factors in clinical decision-making, these new data will also promote important dialogue between clinicians and patients. Ultimately, this will assist with improved quality of care, reduced clinician burden and less fragmentation of a person&#39;s clinical record.

Currently, it is common that a single data element is used to capture both sex and gender information, often assuming these two items are one unified idea. This specification describes the specific data elements to be used for independent consideration of sex and gender, and the assessment of their differences promotes the health of women, men, and people of diverse gender identities of all age. Implementing these changes can improve data accuracy for sex and gender information in health care systems.

### Scope

#### In-Scope

The consultative process that has produced this HL7 guide continues the work of the initial GH project and reflects clinical end user needs on balance with contributors from 2SLGBTQIA+ [(fn2)](#fn2) organizations such as Fenway Health and active participants with lived experience from the United States and Canada. Vendors were included from Japan, Germany, India, and the United States.

The in-scope core list of specific gender and sex use-data elements described by the specification, are as follows:
1. Gender Identity (GI)
1. Sex for Clinical Use (SFCU)
1. Recorded Sex and Gender (RSG)
1. Pronouns 
1. Name to Use

This guide builds upon the prior GH logical model by providing HL7 product family specific additions that define how to send the information noted above in:
1. FHIR
    1. The FHIR core additions needed to support the GH model *are not defined in this guide/*, instead they are found in the R5 FHIR Core ballot.
    1. This guide contains:
        1. Informative description of the FHIR additions
        1. A discussion of design decisions that led to the chosen approach
        1. A discussion of how to "pre-adopt" the R5 extensions into implementations prior versions of FHIR
        1. Detailed FHIR examples based upin a common set of uses cases
1. V2
    1. The new V2 segments needed to support the GH model *are not defined in this guide/*, instead they are found in the V2.9.1 ballot.
    1. This guide contains:
        1. Informative description of the V2 segment additions
        1. A discussion of design decisions that led to the chosen approach
        1. A discussion of how to "pre-adopt" the new v2.9.1 segments into implementations using prior version of V2
        1. Detailed V2 examples based upin a common set of uses cases
1. CDA
    1. The new CDA entry templates needed to support the GH model *are defined within this guide/*.
    1. This guide contains:
        1. The STU definition of entry templates to be used for the in-scope items noted above.
        1. A discussion of design decisions that led to the chosen approach
        1. A discussion of how to include the new entry templates into current CDA-based implementations, including C-CDA
        1. Detailed CDA examples based upin a common set of uses cases
1. Terminology artifacts
    1. Value sets and code systems needed for these artifacts are defined in the FHIR R5 ballot and are used consistantly across all product families.
    1. Given the constraint in CDA to *not include* null-flavor codes within the "clinical content" value sets, the CDA entry templates bind to value sets that do not contain null-value concepts. Those "core" value sets are then used to create the complete value set used elswhere. 

The guide contains illustrative use cases and linked examples that exchange the same use-case patient information, but each using the proper new product-family-specfic artifacts. 
#### Out-of-Scope

The Gender Harmony Project considered other data elements or attributes for the specification but has deferred those for future consideration because these categories did not meet the rigor necessary for Balloting at the present time. Work reserved for future consideration include:
1. Defining or modeling the representation of patient sexual orientation. 
1. Titles, Honorifics and/or Salutations.
1. Representations of the provenance and qualifications needed for the collection of sex and gender identity information.

### Intended Audience

#### Government / Regulatory

Regulatory, legal and research organizations have a vested interest in a consistent approach to documenting sex, gender and related information not only for patient care purposes (primary/acute/tertiary care, lab/diagnostics, allied health, ADT/administration, insured/payor, etc.) but also for a wide range of research, social service integration, public health, population health, epidemiology, cancer staging and registry, and national/international medical record exchange purposes.

#### Standards Development Organizations (SDO)

Messaging and interchange standards developers and standardized terminology organizations play a role in implementing guidance around distinguishing, capturing, and sharing gender and sex information. Having all of these organizations subscribe to the guidance in this specification will assist to bridge the gap between technology and implementation requirements. 

#### Vendors

All the sex and gender information described in this document requires engaged review and implementation support from all EHR system vendors to have a meaningful impact on patient care and clinical interactions. By including guidance for v2, FHIR, CDA, and working closely with DICOM, X12, and others, we hope to enable adoption of the Gender Harmony approach across the vendor spectrum. Vendors are encouraged to incorporate the intent of the specification into the end-user workflow.

#### Researchers

Demographic information that identifies male/men or female/women participants is a core segmentation in study design. It is clear that the historical binary approach to sex and gender data capture has affected gender and sex analysis and reporting. Some research studies refer to this cohort variable as sex, some refer to it as gender. Though the notion of sex is recognized implicitly as an important factor in clinical research, more work is needed to standardize the way sex and gender are reported and elucidate the way these characteristics function independently and together to influence health and health care. Incorporating clear distinctions between sex and gender using the approach noted in this guide will help ensure more accurate and precise data analysis.

### Current State

For an analysis of the current state of sex and gender representation we encourge the reader to review the material included in the [Gender Harmony model published in 2021](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=564). 

Of particular note in HL7 models is the use of "Administrative Gender/Sex" as a core data element for sex or gender exchange. Given the lack of clarity and consistency in the use of this "administrative" element, and the lack of a well established clinical value of use for all populations, there has been inconsistency in understanding and significant cooncern regard proper patient care. This guide exists to improve upon that. 

<!-- #### In V2 
PID-8 is "Sex" and is defined as

```
This field contains the patient's sex. Refer to User-defined Table 0001 - Administrative Sex for suggested values.
```
This is often descrbed as a value used to determine what bed to assign the patient. Given that this element is the only sex or gender element and has been in use from the initial V2 standard, it has carried any information used for clinical sex, gender, or any other sex/gender related information. It therefore has not had a stable or consistent meaning.

#### In FHIR
The patient.gender element in the Patient resource is defined as
```
Administrative Gender - the gender that the patient is considered to have for administration and record keeping purposes.
```
FHIR kept the single element approach used by V2 and therefore also forced implementers to use this one field to represent clinical sex, gendder, or any other sex-related information needed. 

#### In CDA
TBD -->


### Impact of Sex and Gender on Clinical Care
In 2016, The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey which asked 27,715 self-identified transgender persons about their experiences in health care, noted that 33% had at least one negative experience with a health care provider related to being transgender, that 23% did not seek the health care they needed due to fear of mistreatment, and 33% did not go to a health care provider when they really needed to because they could not afford it (26,75).

As National LGBTQ Task Force Director Rea Carey noted:
    It is outrageous that basic health care is being denied to transgender and gender non-conforming people and that so much additional trauma is being caused by doctors instead of being resolved by doctors. The medical profession must take these data seriously and ensure that everyone in the medical care system knows how to provide transgender- sensitive medical care.

This pattern is not exclusive to the United States. Medical mistreatment and/or malpractice, as well as violence against transgender and gender-diverse persons is well documented in many countries including Argentina (72), Armenia (71), Bangladesh (27,30,70), Bosnia and Herzegovina (71), Brazil (71,72), Canada (32,33,34,72), Colombia (71), Dominican Republic (72), Egypt (71), France (70), Honduras (71), Hungary (70), India (28,29,31,71), Indonesia (71), Iran (71), Italy (70), Japan (70,71), Kazakhstan (71), Latvia (71), Malaysia (71), Mexico (72), Nepal (36), the Netherlands (71), Nigeria (71), Pakistan (31,71), Paraguay (72), Peru (72), Poland (70), Russia (71), Saudi Arabia (71), Serbia (70), Ukraine (35), and the United States (70,72), among others. Oftentimes, such mistreatment compounds with other kinds of mistreatment due to race, caste, socioeconomic status (SES), and disability among other things (26). Between 1 and 2 million U.S. Americans identify as transgender, nonbinary and/or gender-nonconforming (45), with at least 25 million persons identifying as such worldwide (44).

The situation for intersex individuals is not much better. Despite worldwide condemnation of intersex genital mutilation, the practice is still widespread and even hurts non-intersex (dyadic) persons, such as in the case of David Reimer. Reimer, known in medical circles as the patient involved in the “John/Joan” case, committed suicide in 2004 following years of abuse at the hands of medical professionals. Clinicians routinely lie to patients about their status as intersex, obfuscate clinical records, and promote practices which have been shown to have negative effects on patient mental health (46,47,50). As Australian intersex politician Tony Briffa noted in a 2013 inquiry: “If we are talking about coercion, doctors coerce families, parents, into believing by saying: ‘We need to remove these testes [or other sex organs] because it will make your child normal’”. Routine forced sterilization of transgender, gender-diverse, and intersex persons is still common in many countries (51,52,53,54).

Despite the “depathologization3” of homosexuality in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1973, the movement to depathologize transgender persons has been slow, and receives pushback even today. Medical providers continue to add being transgender to problem lists and as diagnoses in multiple jurisdictions, under labels such as “gender identity disorder” (GID). GID was removed from the World Health Organization’s ICD listing in 2019. The LGBT rights director at Human Rights Watch, Graeme Reid noted that, “[t]he WHO’s removal of ‘gender identity disorder’ from its diagnostic manual will have a liberating effect on transgender people worldwide... Governments should swiftly reform national medical systems and laws that require that now officially outdated diagnosis.”

However, despite these calls to action, in the last ten years, transgender and intersex persons continue to report harassment and mistreatment in all areas of medical care: oncology, cardiology, geriatrics, pediatrics, psychiatry, primary care, emergency care, radiology, internal medicine,neurology, obstetrics, gynecology, pathology, surgery, and urology, to name a few (72,74). Transness still appears in problem lists, coded using antiquated terminology from ICD-9 and ICD-10 (and sometimes terminology which is even more antiquated). In some cases, this is performed because providers feel that there is nowhere else in the health record to codify that a patient is transgender, but other cases persevere even when patients specifically ask for it to be removed. This can seriously affect a transgender person’s life, as many jobs require that health records be released to employers or even publicly available for anyone to access. Many of these issues have led to significant morbidity and even patient death.

In 2016, the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, alongside the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Workforce Alliance, launched the Agenda for Zero Discrimination in Health Care, highlighting the importance of respectful care which takes into account the values and concerns of marginalized groups, including those of transgender people (43). The agenda prioritized creation of health care frameworks for adequate monitoring and evaluation of health care systems to ensure accountability and monitor progress of health disparities in vulnerable populations, including transgender, gender-diverse, and intersex persons (47). US organizations like Fenway Health in Boston (84), Callen-Lorde in New York (85) and UCSF Trans Care in California (86) have developed programs and services for LGBTQIA+ communities, as Trans Care BC (87) and Rainbow Health in Ontario (88) have similarly in Canada.

Achievement of these goals in affected populations is not possible without an underlying, consistent structure for data collection. Such data are essential to addressing health disparities and have catalyzed initiatives to improve SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity) data collection at the Institute of Medicine, the American Medical Association, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (4), the Council of Europe (56), the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner (57), ILGA-Europe (58), Stonewall (59), and numerous other organizations worldwide. Third gender categories have even been added in national censuses in India and Nepal (both starting in 2011), despite their removal from the 2020 U.S. Census.

Given that gender and sex-related data greatly impact individual care, it is critical that the health care community create data models that enhance understanding and collection of critical data such as organ inventories; culturally-specific health factors; surgical histories; hormonal histories; chromosomal makeup; interlocking demographic factors; individual experiences of discrimination (such as deadnaming or misgendering), sexual assault, and physical violence; differences in sexually transmitted diseases, cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and mental health conditions, all of which directly impact the health outcomes of transgender, intersex, and gender-diverse populations. Mixing up these data can result in situations of life or death. As former president of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), Jamison Green said: “By not actually addressing what kinds of variabilities exist in people’s sexual4 [sic] behaviors, we blind ourselves to potential solutions to these problems” (62).

Studies indicate that around 40% of transgender persons in the U.S. attempt suicide in their lifetime [26,103]. Afton Bradley at the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood noted in 2017 that there was a “dramatic reduction in those [suicide] attempts when people have access to affirmative care” (61). “We need SOGI data collection to develop effective interventions to reduce and eliminate these disparities,” Cahill and Makadon pointed out the same year, “... If they do not count us, we do not count” (1).

#### Sex and Gender in Quality Measurement
Clinical quality measures traditionally evaluate performance using manually abstracted clinical and administrative data. Electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs) evaluate performance using data extracted from electronic health records and/or digital health information technology (HIT) systems. Patient demographic information is often used simply to specify eCQM inclusion and/or exclusion criteria. As described in the Current State section, Gender and Sex are often represented in a single data element utilizing various coding standards and that inconsistency in data capture and implementation leads to downstream issues for quality measurement instruments and outcomes.

For example, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) produces the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS). Approximately 191 million people are enrolled in plans that report HEDIS results, making it one of health care’s most widely used performance improvement tools. HEDIS covers six (6) domains of care utilization measures, including Child and Adolescent Well-Care Visits, Frequency of Selected Procedures, Identification of Alcohol and Other Drug Services, Mental Health Utilization, Antibiotic Utilization and Healthcare-Associated Infection (HAI) Standard Ratio. For all these measures, individuals with nonbinary gender are excluded from HEDIS utilization measures that currently require a specific gender (male or female). NCQA recognizes this as an issue and has stated that it “continues to track industry standards for nonbinary gender”. In other words, the guidance provided in this specification can help improve representation of nonbinary gender and therefore measurement.

#### Sex and Gender Reporting in Payment for Care
Some EHR systems have already begun to suggest tests or workflows based on sex or gender data which is often inaccurate in describing the needs of transgender, gender-diverse, and intersex persons. For instance, a patient may need to switch their insurance “sex” for a procedure to avoid denial of coverage or to even be offered a procedure or test in the first place. Pharmacies may also have to administratively change “sex” for approvals for particular medications and then switch the “sex” back to avoid denial of coverage (per NCPDP page 11). In addition, providers may have to address dozens of automatically flagged lab results which are irrelevant to the patient but are nonetheless required due to compliance regulations (63).

Switching “sex” fields back and forth may trigger hundreds of new results or diagnostic warnings or messages, adding to the already significant issue of alert fatigue among medical providers. Further, clinicians may miss proper risk assessments based on whether the “correct” sex field is provided. For instance, a transgender woman who is marked as “male” may miss crucial breast cancer screenings, but a transgender woman who is marked as “female” may miss prostate cancer screenings. Only by including contextual data about gender identity, sex assigned at birth, organ inventories, hormone levels, and chromosomal makeup can these issues be sufficiently avoided.

#### Sex and Gender Uses in Data Analysis
Storing and exchanging data in structured formats ensures that EHR and HIT systems are better equipped to notify health care teams of appropriate and preventive services, but this is not an end itself. It is critical to have standardized high-quality data in order to conduct data analysis to address health inequities. While there have been some scientific advancements, there continues to be a dearth of data and literature on health outcomes and experiences for transgender and gender diverse people. Many transgender and gender diverse people remain largely invisible to their care providers, face stigma, barriers to accessing care and related health disparities. Standardized data will facilitate information-sharing for clinical care, research, and public health interventions that can further reduce health care disparities in this underserved population.

There are striking disparities in accessing health services that correlate with gender identity, as well as race/ethnicity and other factors. It is important to consider the intersecting identities and experiences of transgender and gender diverse people, to understand the cumulative discrimination and health inequities this community faces. Intersectionality is a framework for describing the disparities and culminating impact a person or group of people are affected by. Sex for Clinical Use (SFCU) and gender identity with other demographic data can be used to evaluate service utilization and health outcomes for subpopulations.

Currently, data resides in disparate systems with varying degrees of accuracy, preventing information from being used to support meaningful analysis, data visualization and insight generation. The goal is to not only answer questions but advance insights that drive action. Combining self-reported data from patients with clinical observations around the notions of gender and sex allows for rapid and efficient evaluations of emerging trends with more detail than might otherwise be possible. Creating opportunities for increased data analysis can contribute to new approaches to managing care, informing policy and future interventions.

#### Additional Data Coding Examples
The following items are provided as examples that align with the data elements noted within the informative material.

The following tables were created by Clair Kronk. See Suggested Tables in Google Docs [81] for additional detail. These tables include potential extensions to these tables which may be useful in various scenarios. This document includes a 75 other potential values for gender identities, pronoun sets, assigned sex at birth values, among other things. Additionally, it includes usage notes and information to consider in regional implementations.

Cases linked to “Unknown” could be theoretically mapped to ‘U’ and specified answers not included here could be linked to ‘O’, but it is recommended to include the other options provided as necessary based on individual clinical use [81].

Kronk [81] also recommends certain additional terms be required in the US and Canada, specifically:

#### Name to Use
Name to Use per [81]:
> *“This is a person’s name, specifically, the name that they use. This may differ from a patient’s legal name on certain identity documents, from the patient’s name registered with an insurance company, etc., but it is still their name. Do not use terms like “affirmed name”, “chosen name”, or “real name”, or “preferred name” as these imply that a transgender person’s name is somehow lesser than a cisgender (non-transgender) person’s name, and can be chosen to be ignored.”*

Cases linked to unknown (such as pronouns not stated) could theoretically be mapped to ‘U’ and neopronouns like ze/zir and xie/hir could be linked to ‘O’ in this situation, but it is recommended to include other pronouns provided as necessary based on individual clinical use. Please also note, a patient record may utilize more than one pronoun set.

##### FootNote(s)
###### fn1
<sup>A grouping term describing individuals who experience gender marginalization, meaning those individuals who belong to gender-related groups who are, or have been, systematically oppressed. Another term which is used to the same effect is people of marginalized genders.</sup>

###### fn2
<sup>Typically, this initialism is taken as meaning Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, questioning/queer, intersex, and asexual/aromantic/agender, and other umbrella sexual- and gender-marginalized groups (“+”), dependent on socio-cultural factors. This initialism (or any number of different initialisms) may be used differently by other individuals or groups at different times. Additionally, the term “queer” may be considered offensive by some individuals. The 2SLGBTQIA+ community is not a monolith.</sup>
