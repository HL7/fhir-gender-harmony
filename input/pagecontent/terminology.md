# **8. Terminology**
Medical terminology and standards, as core parts of medical systems, are necessarily omnipresent in todayâ€™s biomedical landscape. They form an important cornerstone of almost all digital health technology utilized today around the world. However, despite their increasing importance to health care, medical terminology and standards rarely consider the ethical implications surrounding their existence. Many communities have been adversely affected by this lack of consideration, which this document hopes to partially address in relationship to sex and gender in such systems, with a worldwide perspective.
